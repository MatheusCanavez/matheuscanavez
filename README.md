Hi there ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Freelance
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON, SQL, NODE, REACT
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about In 2015 I took a technical course on systems development in parallel to high school, where I fell in love with programming. At the end of the course and high school, I had an opportunity in my first job to work with marketing and design. Today with a degree in digital marketing and more than 6 years of experience in design, I am looking for a career transition to web development. I intend to specialize in this area of â€‹â€‹technology that I love so much and in the future to be a great technology professional, navigating and understanding in depth about how everything works in practice, being able to contribute with this experience in any online business.
